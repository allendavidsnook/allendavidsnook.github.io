title: Faster WordPress via .NET with PeachPie
---

I heard about the PeachPie project recently on the Channel 9 podcast (one of my favorite podcasts) - it allows you to compile PHP and WordPress (and plugins) into .NET. As expected, there is a performance boost and also as expected, you don't have to worry about arbitrary PHP running on your site - AND you end up being able to select and build the exact versions of WordPress and the plugins you'd like kinda like package.json does for modern Javascript apps.



I haven't tried it yet, but the idea of a performance and security boost and, oh yeah, the ability to write plugins in .NET is enticing for projects like this blog. I'll add this to my list ðŸ™‚
