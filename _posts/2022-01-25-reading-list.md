title: Reading List for January 25th
---

A  sampling of some the things (engineering and non-engineering) that have been shared with me or caught my attention in the last week or so. I'm going to try to post a post like this frequently.

- [Are we punishing our top performers? | LeadDev](https://leaddev.com/culture-engagement-motivation/are-we-punishing-our-top-performers)
The opening paragraph sums it up well: “Have you ever noticed that being good at your job can feel like winning a pie-eating contest where the prize for winning is more pie?” And some pies are more to my liking than others.

- [How “Engineering-Driven” Leads to “Engineering-Supremacy” – charity.wtf](https://charity.wtf/2022/01/20/how-engineering-driven-leads-to-engineering-supremacy/)
I always love Charity’s well thought out posts and this is no exception. It’s a Jeremiad of sorts on the danger of engineering for engineering’s sake without balancing it with product strategy.

- [Soviet Military Mapping](https://www.sovietmaps.com/node/2)
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union generated detailed maps of the United States (apparently sometimes by walking around and taking notes of building heights and things) - I’ve added this atlas / history of them to my wishlist.

- [Normalization of deviance](https://danluu.com/wat/)
Why I’ve always encouraged new hires to speak up if something seems odd - chances are it is.

- [The Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)
The dangers of shadow hierarchies and celebrity worship when explicit hierarchy is avoided, and how lack of formal structure can work for small projects but undermine getting large things done.
