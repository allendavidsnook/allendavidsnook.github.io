### Fashion
- [Goth Lunar Hoodie](https://lets-be-gothic.com/products/goth-lunar-hoodie) I want this hoodie. I spotted it on DJ Maus (see below in Music) recently.

### Music
- [DJ Maus](https://www.patreon.com/DJmaus) I'm a fan of [Communion After Dark](https://www.communionafterdark.com/) and DJ Maus especially. See always dresses and does makeup with a great goth aesthetic and picks great tracks.
- [MODEified](https://electrozombies.com/music/downloads/various-artists-modeified-by-7/) I just learned about this series of covers by fans and artists of Depeche Mode. So many good tracks. Some needing more work.
- [RGB 32-Band Audio Spectrum Visualizer](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/janux/rgb-32-band-audio-spectrum-visualizer-0f26e0) I kinda want to build one of these. I miss the audio spectrum analyzer I used to pump Depeche Mode into in college.

### Space Race
Yes, this could go under engineering, but it is one of my favorite non-work areas to learn about.
- [Primordial Comic](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/primordial) (Cover picture above) I picked up Issue 5 of 6 of this Cold War, Alt-History, Space Race, Anthropomorphic Thriller last week. The final issue comes out on February 16th.

### Therapy

Definitely needs more balance between engineering and non-engineering stuff :) See you next week with that!
