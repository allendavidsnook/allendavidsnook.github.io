_Below the towers of the citadel, Seems someone overlooked the cost. Forgotten soldier of paradise, now paradise is lost. -- Duran Duran, The Edge of America, 1988_

A new job, finals week, and looking after a void interrupted my regularly scheduled programming. I'm not going to
try and cover everything, but I hope I remember most things I wanted to mention.

It's mostly music this time... and I'm going to be brief...

- I started an awesome new job as a Principal Engineer at a Cellular IoT startup - the culmination of months, if not years, of careful effort - I'm not going to mention them here by name as I like to keep things separated - at least a bit
- [Night Club](https://nightclubband.com/) (the band) played an incredible show in Seattle - best concert I've ever been to
- Massive Ego (the band) [broke up](https://www.synthpopfanatic.com/news/in-memoriam-massive-ego-breaks-up/) - so sad - seemed like things were just taking off for the them
- [The Pet Shop Boys and Soft Cell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv4QNTg1Mps) put out a new song that is lovely and heartbreaking with echoes of 1987's "Always on My Mind" permeating the soundscape
- [Communion After Dark](https://www.communionafterdark.com/), which I just started following last year, celebrated 14 years of surfacing delicious dark tunes
- I'm still at VRChat "Visitor" level, but I finally got back to [Sinister Saturday](https://twitter.com/NecroNeko5/status/1499043271032586244) yesterday after a few week absence due to new job, finals, void sitting. It is so good to be back. So wonderful to see new friends again.

Next week should see a return to longer form writing and some engineering stuff. For now, this is what there is.

P.S. And now I just learned Duran Duran put together a new video for Edge of America just a few years ago. [Here it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drKbHeQ8Drw0)
