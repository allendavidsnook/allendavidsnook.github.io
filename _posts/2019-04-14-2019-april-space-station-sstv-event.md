title: 2019 April Space Station SSTV Event
---

This past weekend, I was excited to see that the cosmonauts on the Space Station were commemorating Yuri Gagarin&#8217;s flight into space with a special Slow Scan Television (SSTV) broadcast. I hadn&#8217;t set up the antenna since we moved into our new home, so I took this as the perfect opportunity to do so.



I managed to capture five images over the three days. The carrier was quite strong, but the modulated signal level was very low until the last day. And then I was able to capture a proper image:







One of these days I will have to invest in a proper rotator. Got a little wet running out into the rain to track the station. Antenna is an Arrow II Satellite Antenna:







Here are the other images I captured (all images captured using Black Cat Systems SSTV iOS App and a YAESU FT-7800):
