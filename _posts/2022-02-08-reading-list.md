title: Reading List for February 8th
---

Some of the things that have been shared with me or caught my attention in the last week or so. A nice balance of engineering and non-engineering this week.

## Engineering
_I cannae change the laws of physics!_

### Leadership
- [The people you're leading have changed](https://andreamiddleton.blog/2022/01/28/the-people-youre-leading-have-changed/) None of us are the same people we were before all this madness started over two years ago. It's time to get to know everyone anew again.
- [Red Light, Green Light or Where You Sit Determines What You See](https://jamessevedge.com/articles/red-light-green-light/) Never forget that you probably don't have the whole picture.

### Software Engineering at Scale
- [Moving Calm to Microservices](https://eng.calm.com/posts/moving-calm-to-microservices) Breaking up the monolith that used to serve the company but is now holding them back. I've been reading a lot about various companies' microservices refactors as they move from slap-it-all-together-to-get-series-A to something that can scale with product-market fit.
- [12 Signs You're Working in a Feature Factory (2016)](https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory) Technical debt and architecture and system level thinking are neglected to build yet-another shiny thing the actual customers might not have actually asked for.
- [Hapi V17 Upgrade Guide - Your Move to Async Await](https://futurestud.io/tutorials/hapi-v17-upgrade-guide-your-move-to-async-await) the shipping label service I helped launch is built on Hapi and I remember our early discussions about async-await. Bookmarking this for future reference... and this one too - updating to [v20](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/4138)

### Staff Engineering Career Advice
- [Backend Engineering](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/backend-engineer/#staff-developer) I liked how GitLab breaks down the responsibilities of backend engineers and how they distinguish the additional expectations of Staff engineers.
- [Career Advancement as a Software Developer in a Flat Organization](https://ask.metafilter.com/314100/Career-advancement-as-a-software-developer-in-a-flat-organization/amp) What's the next step when there is no next step?
- [Why Targeting a Job Title as a Goal Doesn't Work](https://greenleafcoach.com/2021/12/16/why-targeting-a-job-title-as-a-goal-doesnt-work-sharmins-interview-with-ascend-global-media/) Don't just think about the title, but what it is about that title (the responsibilties) that you find attractive. Dovetails nicely with the other links here.
- [Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never Ignore a Recruiter](https://index.medium.com/career-advice-nobody-gave-me-never-ignore-a-recruiter-4474eac9556) I'm getting a lot of recruiter pings lately. Many of them are annoying but there are lessons to be learned.
- [Don't let HR determine your career ambition](https://junglegym.substack.com/p/career-ambition) HR and the C-suite have set up carrots and hoops. Don't let them be the only people in the driver's seat.
- [One Year of Experience, Ten Times](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/sltu6r/20_yoe_11_at_current_job_staff_eng_interviewing/) If you want to level up, you can't just keep doing the same time over and over again.
- [Where do Staff-plus engineers fit into the org?](https://staffeng.com/guides/where-should-staff-plus-eng-report) It helps to know what archetype(s) of staff engineer you align with, and how that fits into your organization.

## Not Engineering
_Here there be monsters_

### Music, Professor!
- [Massive Ego - The New Normal - Limited Mailorder Edition](https://www.outoflineshop.de/back-catalogue/m/massive-ego-the-new-normal-limited-mailorder-edition-cd-ep-button-set.html) Awesome darkwave release that I've been waiting and waiting for. The EP releases this Friday.
- [Ke$ha - C'Mon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8A4QVop3-8&t=1s) A friend forwarded this video to me - said it reminded them of me. Lots of furries.

### Fashion
- [Nucleus - Super Eyelet Long Skirt](https://trippnyc.com/collections/bottoms/products/super-eyelet-long-skirt-1) OMG. I love this skirt. Added to my wishlist.

### Furry Fight!
- [Furries are Leading the War Against a Book-Banning Mississippi Mayor](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxdpen/mississippi-furry-book-banning) So proud to be part of the furry fandom and to support this library.
- [How to Approach Me with Scamcoin Jobs](https://christine.website/blog/scamcoin-jobs-2022-02-01) Xe, a favorite furry engineer, weighs in on the waste of talent that is NFTs.
- [Animaze](https://www.animaze.us/) Make your own avatar that moves as you do (see picture above). Just starting to play with this. Haven't hooked it up to Zoom yet.

### Star Trekkin'
- [A Queerer Version of the Final Frontier](https://twitter.com/outmagazine/status/1490713649287245838?s=21) Blu Del Barrio and Ian Alexander are two of the best things about Star Trek right now. Love Ian's eye makeup for the photoshoot especially.
