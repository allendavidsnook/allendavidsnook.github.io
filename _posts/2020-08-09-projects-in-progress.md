I've added a link to my most recent project... which is still in progress - it is an IoT weather station I started developing as part of my MSEE at UW. So happy to be working with embedded devices again.


Check out the Projects link in the menu above to learn more. I'll be adding more media and details to the repository Wikis soon.
