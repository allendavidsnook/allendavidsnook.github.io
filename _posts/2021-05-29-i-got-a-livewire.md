title: I Got a LiveWire!
---

It's a dream come true! I picked up "Elvira" last weekend at Emerald City Harley. She's a brand new black Harley Davidson LiveWire and a thrill to ride.



Meet Elvira, My Harley Davidson LiveWire



So quiet, so fast, so responsive. With elements from all my beloved bikes of the past, from the Honda Nighthawk, to the Yamaha Midnight Warrior, to the Harley Street Bob. The best of each of them in an electric superbike. This bike perfectly matches my personality, and it scratches itches that only EV enthusiasts, Electrical Engineers and Mobile Embedded Device Developers have!



I'll be posting plenty on this bike and our adventures. Zoom zoom!



PS: I've updated my previous post on the LiveWire with a gallery from the demo rides. Enjoy!
