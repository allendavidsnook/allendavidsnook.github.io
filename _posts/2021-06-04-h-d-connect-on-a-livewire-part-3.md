Parts 1 and 2 of this short series are available here and here.



Featured photo: Dinner ride! First time riding in a group, much less eating dinner with other riders since the pandemic began.



So, with a ride under her belt, let's see what we can see in the H-D iPhone app. I've embedded a gallery below with screenshots. Overall it works ok, once you get used to counting to about 12 for updates to complete (it really needs an indicator that it is retrieving updates.)



It shows my bike's battery status and range and notifies me when it is fully charged. These are the most important things and they appear to work. There are some obvious bugs (like showing me my current location is in Berlin - it isn't... signing up for maintenance reminders didn't "take"... and the riding activity bar graph sometimes shows data and sometimes doesn't.



I haven't tried the suspension calculator next, but will soon. Glad the app is up and running now. Hoping Harley Davidson addresses the bugs - I know mobile apps are hard, but getting them right makes a world of difference to users and their confidence in your work.
