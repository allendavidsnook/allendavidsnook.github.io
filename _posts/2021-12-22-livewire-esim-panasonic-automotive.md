I was researching [eSIMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM) a bit recently and was happy to, yet again, find that my LiveWire electric motorcycle includes the cellular connectivity tech already. Panasonic Automotive partnered with Cubic Telecom of Dublin to include an eSIM in the LiveWire and provide the Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) to manage the fleet.

> Panasonic Automotive also included [FICOSA](https://www.ficosa.com/) and [Cubic Telecom](https://www.cubictelecom.com/) in the development of the LiveWire™ motorcycle. FICOSA, together with Panasonic, designs and manufactures the Telematics Control Unit (TCU) to be installed on LiveWire™ and other motorcycles. Cubic Telecom, based in Dublin, will provide the 3G, 4G & LTE cellular data connectivity in more than 50 countries. This includes the platform required to manage the lifecycle of the eSIM installed in the TCU and operate the service.

Cubic is one of many players in the IOT eSIM and CPaaS space, including other smaller startups like Chicago based [Hologram](https://www.hologram.io/) and Berlin based [EMnify](https://www.emnify.com/).
