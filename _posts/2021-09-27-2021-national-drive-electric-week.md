title: 2021 National Drive Electric Week
---

National Drive Electric Week, Sep 25-Oct 3, 2021, is a nationwide celebration to raise awareness of the many benefits of all-electric and plug-in hybrid cars, trucks, motorcycles, and more.



We were excited to take our 2021 Rapid Red Mustang Mach-E and 2020 Vivid Black Harley-Davidson LiveWire to the Mill Creek event organized by the Snohomish County Electric Vehicle Association. The LiveWire was the only motorcycle, but there were several over EVs and PHEVs to look at, including a Polestar EV.
