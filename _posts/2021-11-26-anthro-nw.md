title: Anthro NW 2021

This was my very first furry convention, <a href="https://anthronw.com/2021/index.html">Anthro NW 2021</a>, held November 18 - 21 at the lovely Hyatt Regency in Seattle. I had an incredible, wonderful time. Over 1300 furries enjoying a special "Furry Feast" and many more beyond that attending. I got a lovely tail made by <a href="https://www.starfursuits.com/">Star Fursuits</a> which fits me perfectly. The fursuit dance competition was my favorite part, as was seeing in-person so many furries (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/omnom_nomnomnom/">Omnom</a>!)I've only known from their Instagram accounts.
