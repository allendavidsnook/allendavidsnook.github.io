title: Cyberlox

I think cyberlox (aka hair falls) might just be the coolest thing I've seen in a while. They come up frequently on my Insta feed these days (what with my dressing in more of a dark asthetic again) and then I was so happy to see them in one of my favorite Omnimar videos - [Ресурс](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbXf9XNSpcc) - where Мария Мар (Maria Mar) rocks a red and black set to great effect:

I need to practice my Russian more :)

And I want to make some cyberlox - probably mostly black with some white and sapphire blue. I think they'd compliment my [new tail](https://allensnook.com/2021/11/26/anthro-nw.html) nicely and it looks like wearing them isn't too complicated:
