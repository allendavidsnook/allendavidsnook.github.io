title: LiveWire Has So Many Things to Try
---

This is going to keep me busy for a while, and that&#8217;s wonderfully OK &#8211; even exciting. I wanted to take the bike further and faster today and I also wanted to try out a fast charger. The club is doing a ride from Lynnwood, Washington to Leavenworth, Washington &#8211; a 110+ mile trip with a 4100&#8242; mountain pass in-between &#8211; which means my new LiveWire might make it, but might not, so I wanted to see how the bike managed its battery with highway speeds.


I ran the bike in Road mode the entire time. Next time I might try Eco. I made it from Bothell to Sultan with 77% or 92 miles of range left &#8211; mostly 40 mph backroads but with about 10 miles of US 2 at proper speeds.


From Sultan back to Monroe saw the battery drop just a bit to 69%. I tried out the fast ElectrifyAmerica charger and it brought the battery back up to 75% before stopping (not sure why it stopped yet.)


And then I was back to Bothell with 57% or 69 miles of range left.


From Sultan to the top of Stevens Pass is 42 highway miles (with that elevation gain too) and unfortunately there are a few Level 1/2 chargers along the way but no fast chargers. Seems like it might be possible (since I can charge a fair bit on the mostly downhill from the pass to Leavenworth &#8212; 35 miles &#8212; but will it be enough &#8211; and how much will the highway speeds and elevation gain eat into that?)


Net net: clearly more experimentation is called for ðŸ™‚
